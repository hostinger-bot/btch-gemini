  success: true,
  content: "The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  There's no single, universally accepted answer.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, varying greatly from person to person.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that embracing this absurdity is crucial.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual/Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice, finding meaning in contributing to the well-being of humanity.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and avoiding pain.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  Consider what brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.  What values are important to you? What impact do you want to have on the world?  These are all questions that can help you define your own personal meaning of life.\n"
