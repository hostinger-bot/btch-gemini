  success: true,
  content: "The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries. There's no single, universally accepted answer.  The meaning is often considered subjective and personal, varying greatly depending on individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, contributing to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and avoiding pain.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it. It's a question of personal reflection and discovery.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose.  What values are important to you?  What impact do you want to have on the world?  The answers to these questions may help you define your own personal meaning of life.\n"
