    '* **Spiritual or Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers to the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven Life:** Defining meaning through contributions to society, relationships, personal growth, or creative endeavors.\n' +

    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery, and the answer may evolve throughout your life.\n"
