gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if there is one, is often considered deeply personal and subjective.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless, but individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Religious and spiritual beliefs:** Many religions offer answers to the meaning of life, often involving a divine plan, serving a higher power, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, many find it more fulfilling to focus on living a meaningful life by pursuing goals, building relationships, contributing to something larger than oneself, and finding joy in the experiences along the way.\n"
