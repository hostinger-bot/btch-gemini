  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself is deeply philosophical and has been pondered by people across cultures and throughout history.  Different perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.  There's no pre-ordained meaning.\n" +
    '* **Absurdism:**  Acknowledges the conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.  Finding meaning involves embracing this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal of life.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, contributions to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question.  What gives your life meaning might be different from what gives someone else's life meaning.  It's often something discovered through experiences, reflection, and the choices you make.\n"
