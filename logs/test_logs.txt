  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself is philosophical, and the answer depends heavily on individual beliefs, values, and experiences.  Some common perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.  There's no pre-ordained meaning; we are free to define it.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Absurdism:**  Acknowledging the inherent conflict between humanity's search for meaning and the universe's apparent lack of it.  Finding meaning lies in embracing this absurdity.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Religious and Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.  These meanings vary widely across different faiths.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Utilitarianism:**  Focusing on actions that maximize happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Purpose-driven life:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, whether it's a cause, a community, or a creative endeavor.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a personal question.  It's something you must explore and define for yourself.  There's no right or wrong answer, only the answer that resonates most deeply with you.\n"
