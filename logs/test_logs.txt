  success: true,
  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a verdant landscape.  It's a fairly standard portrait-style photograph, likely taken during a public appearance or visit to a location in Indonesia.  There's nothing overtly specific about the image's context beyond showing the president in a relaxed but formal pose.\n"

  content: 'This video shows a Rickroll. It begins with a close-up shot of Rick Astley‚Äôs face as he‚Äôs about to sing. Then the video abruptly cuts to an image of his feet with the words ‚ÄúGet Rick Rolled‚Äù written in white across the screen. In the following few frames, the singer‚Äôs face reappears as he is singing, with the phrase ‚ÄúGet Rick Rolled‚Äù overlaid again. The rest of the video shows a slightly blurry and desaturated image of Rick Astley singing into a microphone. \n' +

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered to be something that is personally defined and can change over time.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, yet we must continue to search anyway.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine plan.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The belief that the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain is the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human connection, creativity, and contribution to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question.  What gives *your* life meaning might be different from what gives someone else's life meaning.  It's a question of ongoing exploration and self-discovery.\n"
