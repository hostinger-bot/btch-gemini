  success: true,
  content: "The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries. There's no single, universally accepted answer.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.\n' +
    '* **Religious and Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, achieving enlightenment, or following a divine plan.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it. It's a question of personal discovery and ongoing reflection.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you purpose, joy, and fulfillment.  What values guide your actions? What impact do you want to have on the world?  The answers to these questions might help you define your own personal meaning of life.\n"
