  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The meaning of life is a deeply personal and philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for millennia.  Different individuals, cultures, and philosophies offer diverse perspectives:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** This philosophy asserts that life is inherently meaningless. There is no objective purpose or value.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:**  This emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility.  The meaning of life isn't predetermined; it's created through our choices and actions.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Absurdism:** This acknowledges the conflict between humanity's search for meaning and the universe's apparent lack of inherent purpose.  The meaning is found in embracing this absurdity.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions provide answers, often involving a higher power, divine purpose, and an afterlife.  These meanings often center around serving God, following religious teachings, and achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** This emphasizes human reason, ethics, and social justice.  Meaning is found in contributing to human flourishing and creating a better world.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** This focuses on pleasure and happiness as the ultimate goals.  Meaning is found in maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of self-discovery and personal values.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?  What impact do you want to have on the world?  These are questions to consider in your own search for meaning.\n"
