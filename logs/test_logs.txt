  content: 'This video depicts a segment of the music video for Rick Astley‚Äôs song ‚ÄúNever Gonna Give You Up.‚Äù The clip opens with a close-up of Astley‚Äôs face, before cutting to his shoes as he taps his feet. Next, the perspective pulls back to show Astley‚Äôs upper body and his microphone as he sings and sways along with the song. The video has a soft, pastel aesthetic and a slight, hazy effect.  The superimposed text ‚ÄúGET RICK ROLLED‚Äù appears across the top and center of the video from¬†[00:00:01] to¬†[00:00:06]. The song‚Äôs lyrics go as follows:\n' +

  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.  Finding meaning despite this conflict is key.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, a divine plan, or an afterlife.  These meanings often center around serving God, following religious principles, and achieving spiritual enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal in life.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice.  Meaning is found in contributing to human flourishing.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?  That might be a starting point in defining your own meaning.\n"
