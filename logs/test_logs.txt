  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning of life is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that embracing this absurdity is key to finding meaning.\n' +
    '* **Religious and Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, a divine plan, or an afterlife.  These meanings often involve serving a god, following a set of moral principles, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and the pursuit of happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  What brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose?  That's likely a key part of your own answer.\n"
