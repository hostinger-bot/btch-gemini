  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual or Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, an afterlife, or service to a higher power.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focus on human values and reason, emphasizing ethical behavior and social responsibility.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it. It's a question of personal discovery and continuous exploration.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose.  What impact do you want to have on the world? What kind of person do you want to be?  These are questions that can help you define your own meaning of life.\n"
