His trousers are light in color and his shoes are black dress shoes. From this point on, the full shot shows Astley in a dark blazer, a short-sleeved, horizontally striped button-down, and light-colored trousers. Behind him is a blurry image of a large, white window or surface with a darker pattern superimposed over it. \n' +

  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning of life is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, yet we must continue to search.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics to find meaning in life.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and avoiding pain.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, many find meaning in:\n" +

    '* **Relationships:** Connecting with loved ones and building strong bonds.\n' +
    '* **Contribution:** Making a positive impact on the world, however small.\n' +
    "* **Growth and Learning:** Continuously expanding one's knowledge and skills.\n" +
    '* **Experiences:** Exploring the world and engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment.\n' +
    "* **Purpose:**  Finding something you're passionate about and dedicating yourself to it.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The journey of discovering the meaning of life is often more important than finding a single, definitive answer.\n'
