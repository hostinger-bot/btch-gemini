  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a lush green landscape.  The context suggests it's likely a candid shot taken during a visit to a forested area or park, possibly in relation to an official engagement or a more informal moment during a trip.  There's no specific event tied to the photo directly from just the image.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries. There's no single, universally accepted answer.  The meaning is often considered deeply personal and subjective.  What gives life meaning for one person might be meaningless to another.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe, and the embrace of that conflict.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine plan.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary purpose of life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  It's a journey of self-discovery rather than a destination with a single, definitive answer.\n"
