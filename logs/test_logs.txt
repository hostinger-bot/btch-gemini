gemini_image Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a verdant landscape, likely a forest or plantation.  The image likely depicts him during a visit or inspection of some kind related to Indonesian natural resources or environmental policy.  The context is missing, but the picture is a fairly standard portrait-style image of the President in a setting designed to convey a sense of his connection to the Indonesian landscape.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning of life is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions provide answers to the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    `Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of searching for a single "correct" answer, many find meaning in pursuing goals, building relationships, contributing to something larger than themselves, and experiencing the joys and challenges of life.\n`
