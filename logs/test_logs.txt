  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, varying greatly depending on individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +

    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** Focuses on human values and ethics, emphasizing reason, compassion, and social justice as sources of meaning.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goals of life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery, not a problem with a single, objectively correct solution.\n"
