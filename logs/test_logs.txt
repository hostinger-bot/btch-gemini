  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if any, is often considered to be something each person must discover for themselves.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that this absurdity should be embraced.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual/Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The belief that pleasure and happiness are the ultimate goals of life.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-Driven Life:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective question.  What gives your life meaning might be different from what gives someone else's life meaning.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, many find it more fruitful to focus on living a fulfilling and meaningful life according to their own values and beliefs.\n"
