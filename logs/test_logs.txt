  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  Different perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.\n' +
    '* **Religious perspectives:** Many religions provide answers based on faith, divine purpose, and an afterlife.  These meanings often involve serving a higher power, following specific doctrines, and striving for spiritual enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question.  What gives *your* life meaning is something you must discover for yourself.  It might be found in relationships, work, creativity, spirituality, helping others, or a combination of these and other factors.  There is no right or wrong answer.\n'
