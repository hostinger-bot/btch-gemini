  success: true,
  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a verdant, forested landscape.  It's likely a candid shot, possibly taken during a visit to a forested area in Indonesia.  The image itself doesn't convey any specific message beyond showing the President in a relaxed, contemplative pose amidst nature.\n"

  success: true,
  content: "The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  There's no single, universally accepted answer.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, varying greatly from person to person.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual or Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The belief that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  The belief that human beings are capable of being ethical and finding meaning in their relationships and contributions to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal reflection and discovery, and the answer may evolve throughout your life.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, many find fulfillment in focusing on values like love, connection, growth, contribution, and experiencing the world around them.\n"
