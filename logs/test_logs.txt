gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that embracing this absurdity can be liberating.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions provide answers to the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and striving for enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The belief that pleasure and happiness are the ultimate goals of life.\n' +
    "* **Purpose-Driven:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, whether it's a community, a cause, or future generations.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?  That's likely a significant part of your own answer.\n"
