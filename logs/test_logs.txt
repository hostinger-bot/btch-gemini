gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often deeply personal and subjective, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, yet we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual or Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divinely ordained purpose.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, contributions to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of ongoing exploration and self-discovery.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose.  What impact do you want to have on the world? What kind of person do you want to be?  These questions may help you define your own personal meaning.\n"
