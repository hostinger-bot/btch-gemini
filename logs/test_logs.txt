    '* **Religious/Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, achieving enlightenment, or fulfilling a divine purpose.\n' +

    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  What brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose?  That could be considered your personal meaning of life.\n"
