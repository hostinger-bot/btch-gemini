  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a landscape of trees.  It's likely a candid shot, possibly taken during a visit to a location of natural beauty or a site related to environmental issues given the background.  The image doesn't convey any specific event or message beyond showing the president in a contemplative moment.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself is deeply philosophical and personal, and different people find meaning in different things. Some common perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** This philosophy asserts that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:** This perspective emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility.  Meaning isn't inherent; it's something we create through our choices and actions.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  This view recognizes the conflict between our search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.  Finding meaning lies in embracing this absurdity.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions provide answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, an afterlife, or serving a higher power.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** This philosophy centers on pleasure and happiness as the ultimate goals.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  This emphasizes human reason, ethics, and social justice as the basis for meaning.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven life:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is subjective.  It's a question you must answer for yourself through reflection, experience, and personal values.  There's no right or wrong answer.\n"
