  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning of life is often considered a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +

    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless, but we create our own meaning through our choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, an afterlife, or serving a higher power.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, contributions to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and avoiding pain.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?  That's likely a significant part of your own personal answer.\n"
