gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  Different perspectives offer various interpretations:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** This philosophy asserts that life is inherently meaningless.  There is no objective purpose or value.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:** This perspective emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility.  Meaning isn't inherent; it's created through choices and actions.  We are free to define our own meaning.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Absurdism:**  This acknowledges the conflict between humanity's search for meaning and the universe's apparent lack of inherent purpose.  Finding meaning lies in embracing this absurdity.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions provide answers, often involving a divine creator, an afterlife, and a preordained purpose.  These meanings vary widely depending on the specific belief system.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** This emphasizes human reason, ethics, and social justice.  Meaning is found in contributing to human flourishing and well-being.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** This prioritizes pleasure and happiness as the ultimate goals in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question.  What gives your life meaning is something you must discover for yourself.  It might be found in relationships, work, creativity, contributing to society, personal growth, or a combination of factors.  There's no right or wrong answer.\n"
