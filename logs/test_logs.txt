    '\n' +
    'Some common approaches and perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** This philosophy asserts that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +

    "* **Existentialism:**  This emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility.  Meaning isn't inherent but is created through choices and actions.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** This acknowledges the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.  Finding meaning lies in embracing this absurdity.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, an afterlife, or serving a higher power.  These meanings vary widely depending on the specific belief system.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** This philosophy focuses on pleasure and happiness as the ultimate goals in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  This emphasizes human reason, ethics, and social justice. Meaning is found in contributing to human flourishing and well-being.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Purpose-Driven Life:**  Many find meaning through pursuing goals, contributing to something larger than themselves, and making a positive impact on the world. This could involve family, career, community involvement, or creative pursuits.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ultimately, the meaning of life is a question each individual must answer for themselves.  There is no right or wrong answer; the search for meaning is often as important as finding it.\n'
