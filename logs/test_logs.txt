  success: true,
  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a lush, green landscape.  It's likely a candid shot, not a formal portrait.  The context is missing, so it's impossible to say exactly *what* is happening in the image beyond showing the president in a relaxed setting.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if any, is often considered to be:\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Subjective:**  What gives life meaning is often deeply personal and varies greatly from person to person.  It's shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, values, and goals.  One person might find meaning in raising a family, another in pursuing scientific discovery, and another in serving their community.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Created, not discovered:**  Many believe that meaning isn't something to be found, but rather something to be created.  We actively shape our own lives and give them meaning through our choices and actions.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Existential:** Some philosophers argue that life itself is inherently meaningless, and it's up to each individual to create their own meaning and purpose.  This can be a daunting but also liberating perspective.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual/Religious:** Many religious and spiritual traditions offer answers to the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, a divine plan, or an afterlife.  These answers provide comfort and guidance for many.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Evolving:**  The meaning of life can also change over time as our circumstances and perspectives evolve.  What was meaningful in one stage of life might be less so in another.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "In short, there's no right or wrong answer.  The search for meaning is a personal journey, and the answer, if there is one, is likely unique to each individual.\n"
