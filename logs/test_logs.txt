  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be something personal and subjective, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +

    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual/Religious beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** Focuses on human values and ethical principles, finding meaning in relationships, contributing to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery, and the answer may evolve throughout your life.\n"
