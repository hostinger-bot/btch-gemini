The scene starts with a closeup of Rick Astley, but it soon changes to his feet as the text overlay "Get Rick Rolled" appears on the screen. Then the scene quickly changes again to Rick Astley singing into a microphone. He smiles slightly, looking directly into the camera while he bobs and sways to the music.\n` +

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning of life is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition that the search for inherent meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Religious and spiritual beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine plan.  These meanings vary widely depending on the specific belief system.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, contributions to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?  That is likely a significant part of your personal meaning of life.\n"
