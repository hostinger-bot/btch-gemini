gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself is deeply philosophical and personal, with different perspectives offered by religion, philosophy, science, and individual experience.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common viewpoints include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Religious perspectives:** Many religions offer answers centered around serving a higher power, following divine commandments, achieving enlightenment, or finding salvation.  The meaning often involves a purpose beyond individual existence, contributing to a larger cosmic plan.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Philosophical perspectives:** Philosophers have explored the meaning of life for centuries, proposing various answers ranging from nihilism (life is inherently meaningless) to existentialism (individuals create their own meaning), absurdism (life is inherently meaningless but we should embrace it anyway), and hedonism (the pursuit of pleasure is the ultimate goal).\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Scientific perspectives:** Science focuses on understanding the natural world, not assigning inherent meaning.  While science can inform us about our origins and the processes of life, it doesn't offer a definitive answer to the question of meaning.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Personal perspectives:** Ultimately, the meaning of life is often a deeply personal matter.  Many find meaning through relationships, contributions to society, creative pursuits, personal growth, or simply experiencing the world around them.  What gives your life meaning might be different from what gives someone else's life meaning.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'In short, the meaning of life is not something to be discovered but something to be created and defined by each individual.  The journey of exploring this question is often as important as any answer you might arrive at.\n'
