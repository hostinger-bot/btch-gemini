  success: true,
  content: "That's a picture of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a verdant landscape.  It's a fairly informal portrait, likely taken during a visit to a location outside of a formal setting.  There isn't much more that can be definitively stated about the image without further context (such as where it was published or what the surrounding text says).\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered to be something that each person must discover for themselves.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless, but we create our own meaning through our choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers to the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is subjective and personal. It's a question of what gives *your* life purpose and significance.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of connection to something larger than yourself?  That is likely a significant part of your personal meaning.\n"
