gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered to be something personal and subjective, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, contributions to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal discovery and ongoing reflection.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you purpose, joy, and fulfillment.  What impact do you want to have on the world? What kind of person do you want to be?  These questions might help you define your own meaning.\n"
