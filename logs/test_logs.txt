    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.\n' +
    "* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics to guide one's life and create meaning.\n" +

    '* **Relationships:** Connecting with others and building meaningful bonds.\n' +
