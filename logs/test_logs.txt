  success: true,
  content: "The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries. There's no single, universally accepted answer.  The meaning is often considered subjective and deeply personal.  What gives life meaning for one person may be entirely different for another.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that embracing this absurdity is crucial.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual/Religious Beliefs:** Many religions provide answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a purpose determined by a divine plan.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, contributions to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of self-discovery and personal reflection.  Consider what brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.  What values guide your actions? What impact do you want to have on the world?  The answers to these questions may help you define your own meaning of life.\n"
