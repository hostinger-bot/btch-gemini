  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a verdant landscape.  It's a fairly informal portrait, likely taken during a visit to a location with lush forestry.  The context of the image would be needed to determine a more specific meaning beyond simply showing the President in a natural setting.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine plan.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal in life.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human connection and contribution.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal discovery and ongoing reflection.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you purpose, joy, and fulfillment.  What values guide your actions? What impact do you want to have on the world?  These reflections might help you define your own personal meaning of life.\n"
