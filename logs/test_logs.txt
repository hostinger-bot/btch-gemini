  content: "That's Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, seemingly looking out at a forested landscape.  It's a posed photograph, likely taken for publicity or official purposes, rather than a candid shot.  The context is lacking, so I can't say for certain what specific event or situation the photo depicts.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition of the conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe, embracing the inherent absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human connection, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal reflection and discovery.  Consider what brings you joy, fulfillment, and purpose.  What impact do you want to have on the world?  These are all potential starting points in your own exploration of this fundamental question.\n"
