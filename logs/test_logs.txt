    "* **Subjective:**  The meaning of life is often believed to be something each individual must discover for themselves. It's personal and deeply tied to one's values, beliefs, and experiences.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Dependent on perspective:** Different philosophies and religions offer diverse perspectives on the meaning of life. Some focus on serving a higher power, others on achieving enlightenment, and still others on contributing to society or finding personal fulfillment.\n' +

    '* **Evolving:**  The meaning of life can change over time as individuals grow and their circumstances evolve.  What was meaningful in one stage of life might not be as important later on.\n' +

    "Therefore, instead of providing a definitive answer, it's more helpful to consider the question as a prompt for self-reflection.  What brings you joy? What are your values? What impact do you want to have on the world?  Exploring these questions can help you define your own personal meaning of life.\n"
