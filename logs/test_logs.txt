gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered deeply personal and subjective, varying from person to person and culture to culture.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, yet we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Religious beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery, and the answer may evolve throughout your lifetime.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose.\n"
