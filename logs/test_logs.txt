    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +

    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe, embracing this conflict.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery, and the answer may evolve throughout your life.\n"
