  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if there is one, is often considered to be deeply personal and subjective.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition that the search for inherent meaning is futile, but that one should embrace the absurdity of existence.\n' +
    '* **Religious and spiritual beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine plan.  These meanings vary widely depending on the specific religion or belief system.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focus on human values, reason, and ethics, emphasizing human potential and well-being.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal reflection, exploration, and the values you choose to live by.  There is no right or wrong answer.\n"
