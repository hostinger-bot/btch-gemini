The background is a faded stained glass window, and the video is edited so that the scene changes slightly every second or so. There are large white block letters at times which spell out the message "GET RICKROLLED". The song starts, and the singer, wearing a black jacket and striped shirt, begins to lip-sync to the music.\n' +

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered deeply personal and subjective, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless, but we create our own meaning through our choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, purpose, and afterlife.  These meanings vary widely depending on the specific religion or belief system.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal of life.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven life:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question to explore through self-reflection, experiences, and interactions with the world around you.  There's no right or wrong answer; the journey of discovery is often as important as the destination.\n"
