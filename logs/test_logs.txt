gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine purpose.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human connection, contributing to society, and personal growth.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and the pursuit of happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?  What impact do you want to have on the world?  These are questions you must answer for yourself.\n"
