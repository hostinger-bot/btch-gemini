The original music is edited so that only a few notes from the song are played along with some drumming to start the video.

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning of life is often considered a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition that the search for inherent meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, yet we must continue to strive for meaning.\n' +
    '* **Religious and spiritual beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human connection, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of seeking a definitive answer, many find meaning in:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Relationships:** Connecting with loved ones and building strong bonds.\n' +
    '* **Contribution:** Making a positive impact on the world, however small.\n' +
    "* **Growth and learning:** Continuously developing oneself and expanding one's understanding.\n" +
    "* **Experiences:** Embracing life's adventures and creating lasting memories.\n" +
    '* **Purpose:** Identifying and pursuing goals that are personally meaningful.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The search for meaning is often a lifelong journey, and the answer may evolve over time.\n'
