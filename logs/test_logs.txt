  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if there is one, is often considered to be subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for inherent meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that this absurdity should be embraced.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, service to others, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The belief that the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain is the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, emphasizing the importance of human flourishing and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  Instead of seeking a definitive answer, many find fulfillment by focusing on:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Relationships:**  Connecting with loved ones and building meaningful connections.\n' +
    '* **Contribution:**  Making a positive impact on the world, however small.\n' +
    '* **Growth:**  Continuously learning, developing, and expanding your horizons.\n' +
    '* **Experiences:**  Embracing new challenges and creating memories.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The question itself is perhaps more valuable than any single answer.  The process of grappling with this question can lead to self-discovery and a richer understanding of oneself and the world.\n'
