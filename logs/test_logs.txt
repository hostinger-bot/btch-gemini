gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered to be something personal and subjective, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    "* **Absurdism:**  The recognition that the search for inherent meaning is futile, but embracing life's absurdity is key to finding fulfillment.\n" +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, an afterlife, or serving a higher power.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goals in life.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics, with an emphasis on improving the human condition.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery, rather than a single, definitive answer.\n"
