  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning of life is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +

    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The recognition of the conflict between the human search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe, embracing the inherent absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary purpose of life.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human connection, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal reflection and discovery, shaped by your values, experiences, and beliefs.  There's no right or wrong answer.\n"
