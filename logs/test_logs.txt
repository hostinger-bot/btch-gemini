  content: 'Sure. This is the "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video by Rick Astley. It has been manipulated to say "Get Rick Rolled" at the beginning. "Rickrolling" is an internet meme that has been around since 2007. The intent is to bait viewers into clicking a link to this video, either under false pretenses or simply as a prank.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The video starts by showing a young Rick Astley about to sing. Text appears saying "GET RICK ROLLED." \n' +
    "The video has a hazy, almost dreamy quality, with Rick Astley performing in a suit jacket and light colored pants. Rick Astley's singing cannot be heard because the volume has been muted in the video."

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered subjective and personal, varying greatly from person to person and culture to culture.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual or Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, a divine plan, or an afterlife.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The belief that the meaning of life is to pursue pleasure and avoid pain.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven life:** Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it. It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.  What values are important to you?  What impact do you want to have on the world?  The answers to these questions might help you define your own meaning of life.\n"
