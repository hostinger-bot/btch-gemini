  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered to be a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine plan.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice, finding meaning in contributing to the well-being of humanity.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it. It's a question to explore through your own experiences, values, and beliefs.  There's no right or wrong answer; the journey of seeking meaning is often as important as the answer itself.\n"
