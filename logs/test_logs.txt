  content: "That's Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, appearing to be looking out at a landscape of trees.  It's a relatively informal portrait, not a staged official photograph.  The context is missing, so it's impossible to say for certain what the image is *about* in terms of a specific event or message.  It could be part of a news article, a social media post, or simply a stock photo.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning of life is often considered a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, many find meaning in pursuing goals, building relationships, contributing to something larger than themselves, and experiencing the richness of life.\n"
