  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking off to the side at a lush green landscape.  The picture is likely a posed publicity shot, rather than a candid moment.  It focuses on him and his surroundings, conveying a sense of calm and possibly suggesting a connection to nature or the Indonesian environment.\n"

  content: `This is an excerpt from Rick Astley's music video for the 1987 hit, "Never Gonna Give You Up." In the clip, the singer stands in front of a translucent, textured backdrop while wearing a dark blazer over a striped, short-sleeved shirt and light pants. A retro microphone is positioned in front of him. He sings and dances as he lipsyncs to the song. The words ‚ÄúGET RICK ROLLED‚Äù appear briefly on the screen in white letters.\n` +

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, varying greatly from person to person.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.\n' +
    '* **Religious and Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers to the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or striving for enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice, finding meaning in contributing to the well-being of humanity.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and avoiding pain.\n' +
    '\n' +
    `Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  Instead of searching for a single "correct" answer, consider what brings you fulfillment, joy, and a sense of purpose.  What values are important to you? What impact do you want to have on the world?  The answers to these questions may help you define your own meaning of life.\n`
