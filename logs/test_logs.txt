  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning of life is often considered a deeply personal and subjective matter.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The recognition that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers to the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goals in life.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven life:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, many find it more fulfilling to create their own meaning by pursuing their passions, building relationships, contributing to society, and striving for personal growth.\n"
