  success: true,
  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a verdant landscape, likely a forest or plantation.  The context suggests it might be from a visit to a location within Indonesia, perhaps related to an official engagement or inspection.  The image itself doesn't convey any specific event or message beyond showing the President in a contemplative pose amidst nature.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  There's no single, universally accepted answer.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, varying greatly depending on individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Religious and spiritual beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, afterlife, or service to a higher power.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values and ethics, emphasizing reason, compassion, and social justice as sources of meaning.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it. It's a question of personal exploration and discovery.  It's not about finding a pre-ordained answer, but rather about creating your own narrative and finding fulfillment in your experiences and relationships.\n"
