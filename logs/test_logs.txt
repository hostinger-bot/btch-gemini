  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if any, is often considered to be something each person must discover for themselves.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:** The philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and responsibility.  Meaning isn't inherent but is created through choices and actions.\n" +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, yet we must continue to search.\n' +
    '* **Religious and Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions provide answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is subjective and personal.  It's a question of what gives your life purpose and value.  Some find meaning in relationships, others in their work, some in creative pursuits, and still others in service to others.  The search for meaning is often a lifelong journey of self-discovery.\n"
