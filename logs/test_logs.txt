  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile view, looking out at a verdant landscape.  It's likely a publicity or official photograph, possibly taken during a visit to a location showcasing Indonesia's natural environment.  The context is missing to be more precise, but it's clearly a portrait of the Indonesian President in a natural setting.\n"

  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The meaning of life is a deeply personal and philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for centuries.  Different individuals and cultures have vastly different perspectives.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common approaches to understanding the meaning of life include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, an afterlife, or service to a higher power.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal in life.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focus on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven approaches:** Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal reflection, exploration, and discovery.  There's no right or wrong answer, only your own answer.\n"
