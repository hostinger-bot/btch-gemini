  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning, if there is one, is often considered to be something personal and subjective, shaped by individual experiences, beliefs, and values.\n" +

    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, yet we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and religious beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question you need to explore and answer for yourself.\n"
