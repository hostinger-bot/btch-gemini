  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if any, is often considered to be:\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Subjective:** What gives your life meaning is likely different from what gives someone else's meaning.  It's a deeply personal and individual experience.  Your values, beliefs, and experiences shape your understanding.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "* **Created, not discovered:** Many believe the meaning of life isn't something to be found, but something to be created or defined by each individual.  It's about choosing your values, pursuing your goals, and finding fulfillment in your actions and relationships.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Evolving:**  Your understanding of the meaning of life can change over time as you grow and your experiences shape your perspectives.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual or Religious beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and achieving spiritual enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics to find meaning and purpose.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ultimately, the meaning of life is a question you must answer for yourself.  Consider what brings you joy, what you value, and what impact you want to have on the world.  The journey of searching for meaning is often as important as the answer itself.\n'
