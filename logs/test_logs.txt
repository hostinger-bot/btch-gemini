  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself is deeply philosophical and personal, and different people find meaning in different things.  Some common perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** This viewpoint suggests that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:** This philosophy emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility.  Meaning isn't inherent but is created through choices and actions.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** This perspective acknowledges the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaningless universe.  Finding meaning lies in embracing this absurdity.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a divine plan.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** This philosophy focuses on pleasure and happiness as the ultimate goals in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Utilitarianism:** This ethical framework suggests that the meaning of life lies in maximizing happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Purpose-driven life:**  Many find meaning in contributing to something larger than themselves, whether it's a cause, a community, or their family.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what *you* make it.  It's a question of personal reflection and discovery.  Consider what brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.  What values are important to you? What impact do you want to have on the world?  The answers to these questions can help you define your own meaning of life.\n"
