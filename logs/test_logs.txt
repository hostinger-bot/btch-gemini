  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered deeply personal and subjective.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The acceptance of the inherent conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal in life.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focusing on human values, reason, and ethics, often emphasizing contributing to society and improving the human condition.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, many find it more fulfilling to focus on creating a meaningful life for themselves and contributing positively to the world around them.\n"
