  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless, but that we create our own meaning through our choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine purpose, an afterlife, or service to a higher power.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice, finding meaning in human connection and contribution.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal discovery and ongoing reflection.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you purpose, joy, and fulfillment.  What impact do you want to have on the world?  What kind of person do you want to be?  These are questions that can help you define your own meaning of life.\n"
