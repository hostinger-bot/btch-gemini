  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  The meaning of life is a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  Different perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that life is inherently meaningless, but individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that embracing this absurdity is key to finding fulfillment.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine plan, serving a higher power, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.  These meanings vary widely depending on the specific religion.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice, finding meaning in contributing to human flourishing and well-being.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Personal Meaning:**  Many individuals find meaning in personal relationships, work, creative pursuits, contributing to society, or simply experiencing the world.  The meaning of life can be deeply personal and subjective.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  There's no right or wrong answer, and the search for meaning can be a lifelong journey of self-discovery.\n"
