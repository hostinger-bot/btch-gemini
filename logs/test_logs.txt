gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  The meaning is often considered deeply personal and subjective.  Some common perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "* **Existentialism:**  The philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and responsibility.  Meaning isn't inherent; it's created through choices and actions.\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that this absurdity should be embraced.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Spiritual/Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, an afterlife, and a purpose defined by that faith.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the primary goal in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Purpose-Driven Life:**  Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal values, beliefs, and experiences.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose.  That might be the closest you'll get to your own personal meaning of life.\n"
