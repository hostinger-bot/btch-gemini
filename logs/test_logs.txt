    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that life is meaningless unless we create our own meaning through our choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a higher power, purpose, and afterlife.  These meanings vary widely depending on the specific religion.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The belief that the meaning of life is to pursue pleasure and avoid pain.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:** The belief that the meaning of life lies in human relationships, compassion, and contributing to society.\n' +

    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question you must answer for yourself through reflection, experience, and the choices you make.\n"
