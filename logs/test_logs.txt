    "* **Philosophy:** Philosophers have explored various perspectives, from nihilism (life is inherently meaningless) to existentialism (meaning is created through individual choices and actions) to absurdism (life's inherent meaninglessness should be embraced).\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Personal Values and Experiences:**  Many find meaning in relationships, pursuing passions, contributing to society, personal growth, or experiencing joy and connection.  What gives life meaning is often deeply personal and subjective.\n' +

    "* **Science:** Science doesn't directly address the meaning of life, but it provides understanding of our place in the universe and the processes that shape our existence.  This knowledge can inform individual perspectives on meaning.\n" +
