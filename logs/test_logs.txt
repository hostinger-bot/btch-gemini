gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:**  The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that this absurdity should be embraced.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice, finding meaning in human connection and contribution to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  Finding meaning in pleasure and happiness.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal reflection and discovery.  What brings you joy? What are your values? What impact do you want to have on the world?  The answers to these questions can help you define your own personal meaning of life.\n"
