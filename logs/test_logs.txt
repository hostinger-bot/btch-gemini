gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered subjective and personal, shaped by individual beliefs, experiences, and values.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:**  The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The recognition of the conflict between the human search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe, embracing the inherent absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Religious/Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values and potential, emphasizing ethics, reason, and social justice.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal discovery and ongoing reflection.  Instead of searching for a definitive answer, consider what brings you joy, purpose, and fulfillment.  What impact do you want to have on the world? What kind of person do you want to be?  These questions may help you define your own personal meaning.\n"
