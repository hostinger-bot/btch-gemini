  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself is deeply philosophical and has been pondered by humans for millennia.  Different individuals, cultures, and religions offer diverse perspectives.  Some common viewpoints include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Religious beliefs:** Many religions provide answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, and achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as the ultimate goal.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focus on human values, reason, ethics, and social justice, finding meaning in contributing to human flourishing.\n' +
    '\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is a personal and subjective question.  What gives your life meaning might be different from what gives someone else's life meaning.  It's a question worth exploring and reflecting upon throughout your life.\n"
