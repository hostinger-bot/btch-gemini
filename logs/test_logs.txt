  success: true,
  content: "That's a photo of Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia.  The image shows him in profile, looking out at a lush green landscape.  It's likely a candid shot, rather than a formal portrait.  The context is missing, so it's impossible to say for certain what the image is *about*, but it could be used to illustrate an article about him, Indonesian politics, or environmental issues.\n"

gemini_prompt Response: {
  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning, if there is one, is often considered to be something deeply personal and subjective.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Different perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and religious beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment or salvation.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal reflection and discovery.  What brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose?  What impact do you want to have on the world?  These are questions you must answer for yourself.\n"
