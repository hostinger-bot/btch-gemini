  content: "There's no single, universally agreed-upon answer to the meaning of life.  The question itself has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for millennia.  Different perspectives include:\n" +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:**  The belief that life is inherently without meaning or purpose.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that this absurdity should be embraced.\n' +
    '* **Religious and Spiritual Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers about the meaning of life, often involving a divine plan, service to a higher power, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human values, reason, and ethics, finding meaning in human relationships, creativity, and contributing to society.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:**  The belief that pleasure and happiness are the ultimate goals in life.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal question.  What gives your life meaning is something you must determine for yourself.  It might involve:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Relationships:**  Connecting with loved ones and building meaningful relationships.\n' +
