  success: true,
  content: "There's no single, universally accepted answer to the meaning of life.  It's a question that has been pondered by philosophers, theologians, and individuals for centuries.  The meaning is often considered to be deeply personal and subjective, varying from person to person and culture to culture.\n" +
    '\n' +
    'Some common perspectives include:\n' +
    '\n' +
    '* **Nihilism:** The belief that life is inherently meaningless.\n' +
    '* **Existentialism:** The belief that individuals create their own meaning and purpose through their choices and actions.\n' +
    '* **Absurdism:** The belief that the search for meaning in a meaningless universe is inherently absurd, but that we should embrace this absurdity.\n' +
    '* **Spiritual and Religious Beliefs:** Many religions offer answers to the meaning of life, often centered around serving a higher power, following divine commandments, or achieving enlightenment.\n' +
    '* **Hedonism:** The belief that pleasure and happiness are the ultimate goals in life.\n' +
    '* **Purpose-driven:** Finding meaning through contributing to something larger than oneself, such as a cause, community, or family.\n' +
    '\n' +
    "Ultimately, the meaning of life is what you make it.  It's a question of personal exploration and discovery, and the answer may evolve throughout your life.\n"
